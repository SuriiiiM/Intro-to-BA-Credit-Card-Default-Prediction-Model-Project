# Intro-to-BA-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-Model-Project

To better manage credit card portfolios and minimize default risk exposure, we search forÂ a machine learning model to predict existing accounts that will default in the next 30 days
-Maximize model benefits by freezing credit limits of accounts that will actually default
-Minimize operational (transactional) profit loss from interchange fees
